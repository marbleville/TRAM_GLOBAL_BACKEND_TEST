# TRAM_GLOBAL_BACKEND_TEST
Backend Developer

Assignment Overview: This assignment is designed to assess your ability to develop server-side
logic, handle databases and ensure high performance and responsiveness to requests from the
front-end.

Task :
A url shortener is a service used by internet users to shorten long, hard to remember URLs into
easy to share shortened re-directs.

You are requested to:
- Create an endpoint that takes in a long URL and returns a shortened one with a random
  short ending.
- Create an endpoint that returns a history of all URLs shortened by a given user.
- Make the short urls actually redirect to their long url counterparts.
- Requests should be tier based. For example a Tier 1 user can make 1000 requests
  whereas Tier 2 user can make only 100 requests. You are free to define different levels of
  tier-ing
- Creation of a user preferred url is recommended over a random url (not mandatory)
  You will be evaluated based on your implementation approach rather than actual
  implementation.
  
Participants can submit the code through a GitHub public repository.
